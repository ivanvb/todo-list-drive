# ToDo List using React & Google Drive (POC)

Another ToDo List using React. However, in this one I am trying to sync the tasks across multiple devices using Google Drive's API. This way my users can have their tasks everywhere and I do not need to store them on a database on my own.

**This is a prove of concept. This project is not meant to scale in any way.**
